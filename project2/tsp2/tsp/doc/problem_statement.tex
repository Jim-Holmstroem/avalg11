Given a list of $N$ points $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ 
find the shortest hamiltonian cycle given the 
euclidian distance measure~\cite{wikipedia:euclidean_distance} 
$d(\bar{p},\bar{q})=\|\bar{q}-\bar{q}\|_2=
\sqrt{(q_x-p_x)^2+(q_y-p_y)^2}$

There will be at most 1000 cities and each point $(x, y) \in \left[-10^6,10^6\right]^2$.

The program should print $N$ lines, where the $i$:th line should contain 
the $i$:th point to visit in the solution path.

The program must solve the problem within 2 seconds.
