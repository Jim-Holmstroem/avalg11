This report describes the implementation of a heuristic that solves the
travelling salesmans problem (TSP). The TSP consists of finding the shortest 
tour through a given number of cities, such that the salesman only visits each
city exactly once and returns to the starting city. 
The heuristic was split into two part, the first part constructing the tour and
the second one optimizing it. For the tour construction, the
\proc{Nearest-Neihgbour} heuristic was implemented and for the optimization
part, the \proc{2-opt} and \proc{3-opt} heuristics. The report concludes that the optimization
part has a big impact on the performance of a TSP heuristic.
