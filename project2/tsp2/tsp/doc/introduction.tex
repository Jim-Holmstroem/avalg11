The TSP is about implementing an efficient heuristic for the travelling 
salesman problem (TSP). The travelling salesman problem consists of finding a 
route for a travelling salesman on a map. The tour should begin in a city, 
visit every city on the map exactly once and finally return to the starting 
city. The problem consists of finding the shortest such tour.

The TSP has several applications, ranging from transportation and logistics to 
the manufacturing of microchips~\cite{wikipedia:tsp}

This report will describe the implementation of an heuristic for the TSP 
problem. Section \ref{sec:problem_statement} states the exact problem 
definition, then section \ref{sec:implementation} describes various algorithms 
for solving the problem and how they were implemented.
In the section \ref{sec:results}, these algorithms are then benchmarked and the 
results of the benchmarks are then analyzed in section \ref{sec:analysis}.
