To conclude, one can see that the optimization step has a big impact on the
performance of an TSP heuristic. Given more time, it would have been nice to
try implement other optimization strategies such as
\proc{Lin-Kernighan}~\cite{wikipedia:lin}, 
since it's our belief that these will probably have a
larger impact on the results than implementing a better tour construction
heuristic such as \proc{Christofides}~\cite{wikipedia:christofides} heuristic.
