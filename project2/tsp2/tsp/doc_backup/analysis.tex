As can be seen in tables \ref{table:nn} and \ref{table:nn_and_2-opt}, adding an
optimization step to the heuristic creates a much better result. 

It is also interesting to note that the score doesn't increase when doubling
the counter in the last row of table \ref{table:nn_and_2-opt}. This means that
\proc{2-opt} has encountered a local miminum and won't find a better solution,
no matter how much more time it gets. One can also see that the number of
iterations of \proc{2-opt} wasn't the worst case scenario of
$\Theta(2^{n/2})$, since the running time isn't more than 0.38 seconds. This
further justifies the claim of \cite{hastad} that the number of iterations in
practice are $O(n)$.
