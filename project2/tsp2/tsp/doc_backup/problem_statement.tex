Given a list of $N$ points of real numbers $(x,y)$, find the shortest path that
visits each point exactly once. The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$,
$(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the function 
$d((x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2)) = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$,
also known as the Euclidean distance~\cite{wikipedia:euclidean_distance}.

There will be at most 1000 cities and for each pair $(x, y)$, $x \leq 10^6$ and 
$y \leq 10^6$.

The program should print $N$ lines, where the $i$:th line should contain 
the $i$:th point to visit.

The program must solve the problem within 2 seconds.
