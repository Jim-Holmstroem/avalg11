This is an implementation of the Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve.
The sieving part was originally written by Scott Contini, using the "lip"
package for multiple-precision arithmetic, and translated to GMP.

Installation.

0) you need first to install GMP (http://www.swox.se/gmp/)
1) then do:

   make GMP=<gmpdir>

   where <gmpdir> is the directory where you installed GMP.

##############################################################################

Usage.

The package contains 4 subprograms:

- 'sieve' is the siever program
- 'combine' to combine the partial relations
- 'buildmatrix' to build the matrix
- 'gauss' which performs Gaussian elimination and solves dependencies

The number to factor is written in a file, which contain also the factor
base bound B, for example (with the c60 file shipped within the package):

% cat c60
213373250047292900922963491789292983262625983360017824143019
125707

Then you have to perform:

% ./sieve -p c60 -n 2700 # n is the number of wanted full relations
...
2702 smooth equations
35113 semi-smooth equations
0 partial partials

It writes the full relations to 'c60.fulls', and the partial relations
to 'c60.partials'.

% ./combine -in c60.partials -out c60.cycles
input file has 35113 relations
found 3206 cycles with 2794 large primes

This combines the partial relations from 'c60.partials' into 'c60.cycles',
and prints on standard error the number of cycles found.

% buildmatrix -fb c60.fbase -f c60.fulls -c c60.cycles > c60.matrix
factor base has 5928 primes
3206 cycles
2794 large primes
2702 full relations
5908 total relations
remains 5908 rels on 5928 primes (excess -20)
discarded 295 singleton(s)
remains 5613 rels on 5542 primes (excess 71)
discarded 48 singleton(s)
remains 5565 rels on 5494 primes (excess 71)
discarded 11 singleton(s)
remains 5554 rels on 5483 primes (excess 71)
discarded 1 singleton(s)
remains 5553 rels on 5482 primes (excess 71)
discarded 0 singleton(s)

This builds the matrix 'c60.matrix' from the full relations and the cycles.
If the last "remains" line says "remains 0 rels", it means you have not
enough relations, so you need to sieve again with a larger -n value.

% ./gauss -fb c60.fbase -p c60 -m c60.matrix
5553 relations
5483 primes with odd exponent
...............................................................................
Found 74 dependencies
Process dependency 1:
gcd(X+Y,N)=396355053225342166863724839683
gcd(X-Y,N)=538338664565940325587701217593

This last program performs the Gaussian elimination, and prints the found
factors.

Alternatively, you can simply type:

% make factor C=c60 N=2700

where <c60> is the input file, and <2700> the number of wanted full relations.

Once you found the factors, type:

% make clean C=c60

to remove the generated files (except the input file).
