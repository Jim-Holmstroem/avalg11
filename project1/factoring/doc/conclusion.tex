The final algorithm being used was Pollard's $\rho$ algorithm with Floyd's
cycle detection toghether with \texttt{rand} for generating random numbers,
since this combination achieved the highest result.

Given more time, we would have liked to invest more time in increasing the
performance of the cycle detection part of Pollard's $\rho$ algorihtm. As a
start, the
Wikipedia article~\cite{wiki:pollard} mentions some adjustments that can be
done to speed up the cycle detection.

We would also have liked to come up with a better algorithm for noticing
numbers that our algorihtm probably wouldn't be able to factor. This would have
saved us time for factoring other numbers that we might haven been able 
to factor.
