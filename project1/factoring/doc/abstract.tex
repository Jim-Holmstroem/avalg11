This report desribes the implementation of an algorithm that factors integers 
into prime factors. Factoring an integer into prime factors means finding a
representation of an integer $n = p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2} \ldots p_n^{k_n}$ where
$p_i$ are primes and $k_i$ are integers.
Three different algorithms were tried (separately and combined): trial
division, Pollard's $\rho$ algorithm and perfect power factorization. Pollard's
$\rho$ algorithm was tried with two different cycle detection algorithms.
The algorithms where then benchmarked using 100 random integers. 
The report concludes
that using Pollard's $\rho$ algorithm with Floyd's cycle detection resulted in
the best performance.
